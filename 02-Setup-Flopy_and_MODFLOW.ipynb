We highlight some of the most useful / important below, with associated links to their webpages and user guides,\n",
    "\n",
    "Different versions of MODFLOW, and associated utilities / subprograms:\n",
    "* `mf2005`: [MODFLOW-2005](https://www.usgs.gov/software/modflow-2005-usgs-three-dimensional-finite-difference-ground-water-model) - The most widely-used version of MODFLOW, which uses rectangular grids in the horizontal, while allowing deformed vertical gridding.  This version of MODFLOW includes a quite useful [Online User's Guide](https://water.usgs.gov/ogw/modflow/MODFLOW-2005-Guide/index.html). Utilities usable with MODFLOW-2005 include:\n",
    "    * `mp6`: [MODPATH 6](https://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/6a41/) - A particle tracking simulator compatible with MODFLOW-2005. MODPATH takes the output of a MODFLOW model (cell-to-cell flow rates) and traces the path a particle would take in that flow field.\n",
    "    * `zonebud3`: [ZONEBUDGET](https://www.usgs.gov/software/zonebudget-program-computing-subregional-water-budgets-modflow-groundwater-flow-models) - A program for calculating budgets / mass balances within subregions of a groundwater flow model.\n",
    "    * `mt3dms`: [MT3DMS](https://web.archive.org/web/20170129200934/http://hydro.geo.ua.edu/mt3d/) - A program for simulating multi-species transport based on the output of MODFLOW-2005 or earlier versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `mfnwt`: [MODFLOW-NWT](https://www.usgs.gov/software/modflow-nwt-a-newton-formulation-modflow-2005) - An update to MODFLOW-2005 that includes improvements in stability for models where drying / re-wetting of cells is common. Note: Most MODFLOW-2005 models can be run through MODFLOW-NWT with only minor edits. Experience shows that MODFLOW-NWT has better convergence but is often slower than standard MODFLOW-2005.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `mf6`: [MODFLOW 6](https://www.usgs.gov/software/modflow-6-usgs-modular-hydrologic-model) - The most recent release of MODFLOW. Key new features include capabilities for fully unstructured grids, and the use of a simulation framework that allows multiple flow models to be run at once, coupled via model exchanges. In addition, MODFLOW 6 has started to incorporate features beyond just groundwater flow (GWF), including solute transport (GWT), energy movement (GWE), and particle tracking (PRT).A useful resource for MODFLOW 6 is the [MODFLOW 6 Online Input Guide](https://modflow6.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mf6io.html)\n",
    "    * `gridgen`: [GRIDGEN](https://www.usgs.gov/software/gridgen-program-generating-unstructured-finite-volume-grids) - A program for creating layered quadtree grids (i.e., refined by subdividing cells of a rectangular grid into 4 sub-cells), for use in codes that support unstructured grids.\n",
    "    * `triangle`: [TRIANGLE](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html) - A program for creating triangular unstructured grids in 2D. (Not created / supported by USGS)\n",
    "    * `mt3dusgs`: A version of MT3DMS updated to accommodate new capabilities from MODFLOW-NWT and new input structures in MODFLOW 6. Currently only compatible with structured grids for MODFLOW 6.\n",
    "    * `zbud6`: [ZONEBUDGET](https://www.usgs.gov/software/modflow-6-usgs-modular-hydrologic-model) version compatible with MODFLOW 6.\n",
    "    * `mp7`: [MODPATH 7](https://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/6a41/) - A particle tracking simulator compatible with MODFLOW 6. Support for unstructured grids is limited to quadtree / quadquadpatch grids. Particle tracking can also be accomplished using the included PRT process in MODFLOW 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other MODFLOW-like programs:\n",
    "* `swtv4`: [SEAWAT Version 4](https://www.usgs.gov/software/seawat-computer-program-simulation-three-dimensional-variable-density-ground-water-flow) - A model based on the structures and ideas of MODFLOW and MT3DMS which simulates variable-density / variable viscosity groundwater flow processes, such as saltwater intrusion in coastal areas and convection-based flow in geothermal regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `sutra`: [SUTRA](https://www.usgs.gov/software/sutra-a-model-2d-or-3d-saturated-unsaturated-variable-density-ground-water-flow-solute-or) - A model that borrows some MODFLOW concepts and simulates saturated / unsaturated and variable-density groundwater flow."
