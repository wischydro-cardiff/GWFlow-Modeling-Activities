    "Every MODFLOW model is solved on a **model grid**, which may be either a structured rectangular (plaid), semi-structured (e.g., quadtree refined), or unstructured grid. Unless you are writing a purely hypothetical MODFLOW model, this model grid is also associated with a place on the Earth and thus should contain coordinate and measurement unit information so that the model grid and associated features can be mapped onto the planet.\n",

    "For almost all cases, MODFLOW grids are \"layercake\", consisting of a 2-dimensional horizontal discretization (usually easting / northing map-view coordinates) that is consistent across all layers of the model. The model top elevation and layer bottoms may be set so that the thickness and position of a layer may vary vertically. This notebook introduces tools and methods for developing MODFLOW model grids in two map-view dimensions (assumed to represent easting / northing coordinates), for introducing variable-thickness layering, and for ensuring that the model grid can be referenced on the Earth.\n",

When developing grids for regional models, it is **very important** to be careful about the coordinate reference system (CRS) used in all geographic data. Each CRS has an associated number called an [EPSG code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPSG_Geodetic_Parameter_Dataset) that defines various aspects of the coordinate system such as the geoid/ellipsoid reference model used, the method of projection from spherical to rectangular coordinates, the units system used, and the origin of the coordinate system.

It is the modeler's responsibility to ensure that these CRSs and datums are kept consistent.\n",

Non-rectangular grids were first supported by [MODFLOW-USG (2017)](https://www.usgs.gov/software/modflow-usg-unstructured-grid-version-modflow-simulating-groundwater-flow-and-tightly), and have since been implemented within the latest major release, [MODFLOW 6](https://www.usgs.gov/software/modflow-6-usgs-modular-hydrologic-model).\n",

We will use the FloPy interface to work with the Triangle software package here. Another useful example of some features of the FloPy implementation of Triangle can be found in the [FloPy Examples Gallery here](https://flopy.readthedocs.io/en/3.8.0/Notebooks/dis_triangle_example.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the output of Triangle produces a set of points defining the corners of every triangle. This is a perfectly acceptable grid, but it leads to some numerical inaccuracies when fluxes are calculated. In MODFLOW, heads are defined at cell centers and thus flow rates are defined from cell center to cell center. If the direction along which a flow rate is calculated (cell center to cell center) is not perpendicular to cell boundaries, error is introduced. In other words, **in a good MODFLOW grid, lines drawn from cell center to cell center should be perpendicular to cell boundaries for the best computational accuracy**. MODFLOW 6 has routines to correct for this issue, but they are not foolproof."
