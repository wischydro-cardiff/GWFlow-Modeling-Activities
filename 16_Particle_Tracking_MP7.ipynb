    "A model is \"solved\" once convergence is achieved for steady state or transient head values. As we've seen in the class so far, this means we can create outputs that show changes in head over time at points in space or throughout the model domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, however, the prediction of interest for a model is something different than head values at a point in space. For example, we may want to know how quickly a lake is losing water to pumping, and how that changes as pumping rates change. Or, we may want to understand the source for water entering a particular region (such as the source of water entering a well).\n",
