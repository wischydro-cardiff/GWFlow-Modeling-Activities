During the first few weeks of the semester, we will focus on the mathematical theory underpinning numerical models, primarily using pencil and paper (we must walk before we can run!). After the first few weeks of the semester, though, we will begin using and developing software to solve specific groundwater flow problems using Python and associated packages / extensions. This guide is designed to get you familiar with Anaconda, conda, Python, iPython, and Jupyter Labs on your personal computer so that you can follow along with the in-class exercises."

    "[**Python**](https://www.python.org) is a programming language, like C, Fortran, or Basic.

It is mainly limited to working with text strings, numbers, and some very basic data structures. If you had Python installed on your computer, and just wanted to work with that, you would go to the Command Line (Windows) or Terminal (Mac / Unix / Linux), and type ```python```. \n",

Python Distributions may also include other helpful utilities that assist with tasks like debugging, visualization, and code management. \n",

Similarly, the distribution you download may not include all of the tools you need to do your work. So now what? Do you wait for a new version from the Distributor? Do you download and add a new package to your existing Python installation and hope it doesn't break anything?\n",

For example, suppose one set of code you're developing requires Package Y version 1.3, and breaks when you try upgrading to version Package Y version 1.4. But on another project, you want to use some of the fancy new features in Package Y version 1.4. \n",
    "\n",
    "To fix problems like this, we can isolate places where we're developing code via **Virtual Environments**. Packages installed within a virtual environment are only usable inside that environment, and won't seem to be installed once you exit a given virtual environment. Thus, you can design your Python virtual environment for the current project your developing without worrying about how new package installations will affect other projects.\n",

In personal experience, however conda's package management utilities are not as robust or reliable for Python.

Good examples would be, on a Windows PC, ``C:\\Coursework\\Geosci724Python\\``, or on a Mac, ``/Users/username/Geosci724Python``. Go to the course github repository, and clone (download) all files into this directory\n",

(Translation: \"Conda, create a new virtual environment. It's name is hydroclass, and it should have python version 3.9 installed within it\") and press enter. To activate this environment type `conda activate hydroclass`. Once activated you should see (hydroclass) before your terminal path.

When you downloaded the github repository in step 2, you should have received a file named `requirements.txt` Now you just need to install all of the python packages that we will use for this class. To do this, type `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all of the packages at once. (Translation: Pip, install the Python packages found in the requirements file named requirements.txt, and make sure to download any dependencies needed too). \n",
