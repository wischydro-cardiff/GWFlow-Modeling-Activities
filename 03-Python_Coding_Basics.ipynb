    "This notebook is meant to give you a brief introduction to coding with Python. Before jumping into the variety of modules, tools, and utilities that have been built by the Python developer community, it's worthwhile to spend some time understanding the basics of the original language (without any add-ons) and some conventions that must be learned.\n",

    "Python is currently listed as one of the most popular coding languages on the planet. There are many reasons for this.\n",
    "* It's open-source and freely available\n",
    "* Code written in Python is often more human-readable than other languages like C or Java\n",
    "* The developer community (including some big names like Google and Microsoft) have written excellent modules in Python for popular tasks like Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and scientific computing, and made them freely available.\n",
    "* Free development tools like Jupyter Lab (hello!) have made coding and debugging more intuitive and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, if you are just getting started with coding, be prepared that there are some things about Python that will cause you grief and take up your time.\n",
    "* There are some strange conventions you have to get used to, like the fact that the first element of an array `a` is numbered `a[0]` (so-called \"zero-indexing\")\n",
    "* There is no \"help line\" to give you official, correct answers. Googling error messages and testing the answers carefully is the coder's responsibility!\n",
    "* Python module developers tend to extend the language by creating their own datatypes/\"objects\" and conventions. Once you start working with more than one Python module, you may find yourself doing a lot of conversion between modules and having to remember different conventions!\n"

    "\n",
    "The thing that makes lists very flexible is that values within a list can be of **any type**. Since lists are a type, you can also **store a list as an element of a list** (sometimes called a nested list). You can also add onto a list overtime using the `append` and `extend` functions.\n",

You can also do something more fancy known as **list comprehension**, which is essentially a way to write a mini-program in one line. While this is very compact, it can quickly become \"clever\" and unreadable.\n",

    "Lists are really the building blocks for many of the complex data structures you will find in different python modules, and - especially if you are using modules from different developers - you will likely find that you have to spend time correctly extracting data from these structures, so it is worthwhile to spend time with the examples below.\n",

    "This may seem like a silly data type to bother with, and in many practical applications you can get away with only using lists. The reason developers like tuples, though, is that they hold data securely and are more memory-efficient once they have been declared. So, you will see tuples from time to time, and it is worth recognizing that they have restrictions."

    "Life was good with built-in Python data types. But then the developers said, \"Let there be new classes!\". And while life continued to be good, it also continued to get more complex. Just by using lists and dicts, we can quickly create data structures that contain varied, nested types of information. When this is done by a developer, it is often done by creating a new **class object** (or just \"class\") with the lower-level datatypes becoming **class attributes**. You will see many new classes when you start importing and working with different python modules. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another core concept of higher-level classes is **inheritance**, meaning that an object containing other objects also carries with it the features of the internal object. For example, if we create a new class that - as part of its definition - contains a string, then we can use all of the functions and properties contained within the string datatype object and also perform operations like indexing of the string. But by defining a class, we can also add and alter functionality; many class objects are often packaged with new **class methods**, i.e., functions that apply to the new class of variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, we will not spend much time on the intricacies of developing or building new class objects. That said, it is worthwhile to understand the concept. When a module like FloPy throws an error, or your forced to looking at the \"guts\" of a module, understanding the idea of building new classes will help you interpret these codes. \n",

    "So far, every program we have written starts at the top and carries out instructions sequentially. The true essence of programming, though, is controlling the flow of your code to accomplish ever more complex tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you've done any programming before, the key flow control statements presented below will be very familiar - they are the same in basically every programming language, just with slightly different syntax. They are your old friends, `for` loops, `if / then / else` statements and `while` loops. Python additionally contains flow control statements that are useful when you are debugging or trying to build in safeguards against user-generated errors. The `try / except / else / finally` structure allows you to try a section of code, check for exceptions (errors), and continue your program running even if an error would have been raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few key conventions that you must remember when using any flow control statements in Python:\n",
    "* You start a section of controlled code by **ending a line with a colon**, such as `for i in range(0,5):`\n",
    "* To start a section of controlled code you must **indent**\n",
    "* To end a section of controlled, **reducing back to the previous level of indentation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike many other programming languages, indentation is required by Python to organize a section of controlled code. And since the indentation is required, there is **no explicit `end` statement** used (or even allowed) when a controlled block of code stops."
